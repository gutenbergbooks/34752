<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>A small volume of poems entitled, &ldquo;Home Here
and Home in Heaven,&rdquo; by Annie R. Smith, appeared
shortly after her death, in 1855. Her numerous
friends wishing some account of her life and last
sickness, have from time to time desired me to prepare
such a sketch for publication. I have also been
requested to publish in connection therewith, a collection
of my own poetical efforts. This is the immediate
occasion of the appearance of the present
volume, the publication of which, circumstances have
conspired to delay till the present time. It lays no
claim to literary merit, but professes to be only a
description in rhyme of some of the ordinary experiences
of life, and the common feelings of the heart.
I have appended some additional pieces written by
Annie R. Smith, and some by Uriah Smith, which I
have desired to see published in this form. It is commended
<span class="pb" id="Page_004">[004]</span>
to the charitable consideration of friends,
with the hope that its appearance may prove a gratification
and a benefit to some.</p>

<h2>POEMS.</h2>
<h3 id="c1">Life&rsquo;s Conflict.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In the deep recess of the inmost heart,</p>
<p class="t">Where Satan tempts and angels come to shield,</p>
<p class="t0">Are foes by which we would be overcome,</p>
<p class="t">Were Christ not with us on the battle-field.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The tempter, seeking whom he may devour,</p>
<p class="t">Would sift as wheat, and finally prevail;</p>
<p class="t0">But Jesus intercedes and prays for us,</p>
<p class="t">That faith in these dread conflicts may not fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">These calls unheeded, who the end can know?</p>
<p class="t">The Spirit grieved and angels forced to leave,</p>
<p class="t0">The victims, though unconscious, hastening where</p>
<p class="t">No pardoning love is found, and no reprieve.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If yet there&rsquo;s hope, one mighty effort make</p>
<p class="t">To conquer, and the enemy defeat;</p>
<p class="t0">Watch unto prayer, in Jesus Christ abide,</p>
<p class="t">And hasten to be made in him complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">No true enjoyment here aside from this.</p>
<p class="t">No other name on earth e&rsquo;er to be given,</p>
<p class="t0">Through him we must be cleansed and purified,</p>
<p class="t">Or closed to us will be the gates of Heaven.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_006">[006]</div>
<h3 id="c2">Christian Love.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus sees, he feels, he pities; he for us keen anguish knew,</p>
<p class="t0">He was numbered with transgressors; harmless, but his friends were few.</p>
<p class="t0">Those immersed in love&rsquo;s deep ocean, nothing will or can offend;</p>
<p class="t0">They will bow in sweet submission, knowing Heaven will them defend.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let us then our suffering brother seek where&rsquo;er his lot is cast;</p>
<p class="t0">Priests and Levites having seen him, on the other side have passed;</p>
<p class="t0">But of God he&rsquo;s not forsaken; He has known each bitter pang;</p>
<p class="t0">He has seen his tears and sorrows, and has known from whence they sprang.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus sees when best to succor, every wrong will bring to light;</p>
<p class="t0">He will have obedient children who in doing good delight,</p>
<p class="t0">Who will move in love and pity, bleeding wounds to soothe and bind,</p>
<p class="t0">Good Samaritans, who ever seek some path of love to find.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Courage new is then imparted, chilling words no more oppress;</p>
<p class="t0">Oh! for more true kindred spirits, who would make our sufferings less.</p>
<p class="t0">Lord forgive thine erring people; form them for thyself alone;</p>
<p class="t0">Then they&rsquo;ll bear each other&rsquo;s burdens, calling nought they have their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_007">[007]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then each suffering child of sorrow would be watched with tender care,</p>
<p class="t0">Love and pity for the erring would be felt and witnessed there.</p>
<p class="t0">Strife and jealousy would vanish; love be felt that works no ill;</p>
<p class="t0">Peace, sweet peace, and joy and gladness, would each home and bosom fill.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c3">Love Not the World.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love not the world, trust not its joys; uncertain is their stay;</p>
<p class="t0">Its treasures I&rsquo;ve so highly prized, on wings have flown away.</p>
<p class="t0">Its riches I would not recall, their loss would not deplore;</p>
<p class="t0">Content I&rsquo;ll be if but my Lord salvation&rsquo;s joys restore.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nature inclines us all to seek, a rich and grand career;</p>
<p class="t0">Undue attachment will but make our losses more severe.</p>
<p class="t0">Hardly we know how much we love our friends and things below,</p>
<p class="t0">Till called to see them one by one from our possession go.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How often then the stricken heart deplores no comfort left,</p>
<p class="t0">Forgetting we have blessings still, of which we&rsquo;re not bereft.</p>
<p class="t0">Let houses, lands and splendor go, surroundings all upset,</p>
<p class="t0">If home is where we&rsquo;ve friends to love, and friends to love us yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_008">[008]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With such a home, no matter where, how unadorned the place,</p>
<p class="t0">If but my Lord&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;ll visit there, and with his presence grace.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus consecrated to the Lord, his glory will be there.</p>
<p class="t0">How blest the place where oft is heard the voice of praise and prayer.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Be I but meet for such a place, where angels camp around,</p>
<p class="t0">Where truth and duty are proclaimed, and works of love abound.</p>
<p class="t0">The poor and friendless there resort and find their wants supplied,</p>
<p class="t0">No lack whose trust is in the Lord; for such he will provide.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There all of every name and race, in need of friendly aid,</p>
<p class="t0">Find equal welcome to the board where no distinction&rsquo;s made.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus treasures are laid up above, where endless life is given;</p>
<p class="t0">They who are rich in works of love, may hope for rest in Heaven.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c4">Preparation for Heaven.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Our every sin must be confessed,</p>
<p class="t0">All guile be taken from the breast;</p>
<p class="t0">A holy life must we maintain,</p>
<p class="t0">If with the Saviour we would reign.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Be trimmed our lamps, our light appear,</p>
<p class="t0">Proclaim we Jesus draweth near;</p>
<p class="t0">That mercy&rsquo;s closing hour is nigh,</p>
<p class="t0">Will be the angel&rsquo;s last loud cry.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_009">[009]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now are we drawing near the port,</p>
<p class="t0">Decisions soon all made in court,</p>
<p class="t0">The scene will close, the Lord will come,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And who with him will have a home?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To self we must be crucified,</p>
<p class="t0">Be purified, made white and tried,</p>
<p class="t0">Without one spot, and guileless be,</p>
<p class="t0">To stand before his Majesty.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh! be our sleeping powers awake;</p>
<p class="t0">Eternal bliss is now at stake;</p>
<p class="t0">One wrong unrighted, spot or stain,</p>
<p class="t0">Will bind in sin&rsquo;s destructive chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Haste then, from every error flee;</p>
<p class="t0">Strive till you gain the victory.</p>
<p class="t0">Triumph in Jesus&rsquo; name alone,</p>
<p class="t0">And sit with him upon his throne.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This right with his own blood he bought;</p>
<p class="t0">Oh! bliss beyond all human thought,</p>
<p class="t0">Where ransomed throngs the Lord adore,</p>
<p class="t0">And sing free grace forevermore.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c5">Submission.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Saviour knows our every grief;</p>
<p class="t0">He knows the time to give relief:</p>
<p class="t0">When we are purified and tried,</p>
<p class="t0">And our whole wills are sanctified.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How to destroy our dross and tin,</p>
<p class="t0">And cleanse us from each stain of sin,</p>
<p class="t0">What to inflict, the Lord knows best;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis only ours to stand the test.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_010">[010]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What though we suffer grief and pain,</p>
<p class="t0">And earth&rsquo;s fair prospects strew the plain,</p>
<p class="t0">Let us submit, whate&rsquo;er befall,</p>
<p class="t0">And make our God our all in all.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What though we&rsquo;re wrongfully accused,</p>
<p class="t0">Oft times e&rsquo;en slanderously abused?</p>
<p class="t0">Say not these ills we cannot bear,</p>
<p class="t0">But in our Saviour&rsquo;s suffering share.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What he endured no tongue can tell,</p>
<p class="t0">When on Him our transgressions fell;</p>
<p class="t0">Meekly he bore them on the tree,</p>
<p class="t0">And paid the debt for you and me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He purchased holiness and Heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">Or we could ne&rsquo;er have been forgiven.</p>
<p class="t0">The Saviour&rsquo;s blood redemption cost,</p>
<p class="t0">Without which all our race was lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Shall we then sink beneath the rod,</p>
<p class="t0">Inflicted by a holy God</p>
<p class="t0">To purify and make us white,</p>
<p class="t0">That he may be our sole delight?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">No; though it sharply smites, resign,</p>
<p class="t0">And pray for grace and love divine;</p>
<p class="t0">For all this, Heaven will make amends,</p>
<p class="t0">And ofttimes quick deliverance sends.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Lord in him would have us free;</p>
<p class="t0">Through Him we gain the victory,</p>
<p class="t0">All he will be to us we need,</p>
<p class="t0">That we a holy life may lead.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Be holy. Oh! how blest to know,</p>
<p class="t0">Our Father helps to make us so;</p>

<h2 id="c77">A BRIEF SKETCH
<br /><span class="smaller">OF THE</span>
<br /><i><span class="large">Life, Last Sickness and Death</span></i>
<br /><span class="smaller">OF</span>
<br />ANNIE R. SMITH.</h2>
<p>Annie Rebekah Smith, only daughter of Samuel
and Rebekah Smith, was born in West Wilton,
N. H., March 16, 1828. When ten years of age, she
was converted and joined the Baptist church, in which
connection she remained till 1844, when she embraced
the doctrine of the soon coming of Christ,
and withdrew from the church that she might more
freely engage in the work of preparation for that
event. After the passing of the time in 1844, being
thrown with others into doubt respecting our position
in the prophetic calendar, she pursued her favorite occupations
of studying and teaching. Commencing
in 1844, as assistant in a select school kept by Miss
Sarah Livermore, in Wilton, between that time and
1850 she taught, in different places, seven district
schools, attending, meanwhile, a term each in Milford,
Hancock and New Ipswich, N. H., and six
terms at the Ladies&rsquo; Female Seminary in Charlestown,
Mass. At the latter place she fitted herself for
a teacher in Oil Painting and French.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_098">[098]</div>
<p>In 1850 she took a sketch of Boston and Charlestown
from Prospect Hill, Somerville, three miles
distant. The effort was too much for her eyes, and,
for about eight months she almost entirely lost the
use of them. On account of this difficulty, she was
obliged to decline a proposition to teach in the seminary
at Hancock, which made her misfortune seem
almost intolerable, so great was her disappointment.
The only alleviation which she found for her affliction
in this time, was in becoming an agent for, and
contributor to, &ldquo;The Ladies&rsquo; Wreath,&rdquo; a monthly
magazine published in New York. Her contributions
to this periodical, with the exception of a few
pieces published in the &ldquo;Odd Fellow,&rdquo; and some
other papers, were her first efforts at public writing.</p>
<p>Her friends in Charlestown, thinking the salt water
would prove a benefit to her eyes, invited her to
spend a season with them. She went in 1851, not
expecting to be gone many weeks, but did not return
till November, 1852, when she was called home by
the sickness and death of her father. During her stay
in Boston and vicinity she went to Portland and
Nova Scotia. I requested her to go once, to please
me, to sister Temple&rsquo;s, in Boston, to a Seventh-day
Adventist meeting. Some remarkable incidents in
connection with her attendance at this meeting, together
with the faithful efforts of the friends of the
truth, arrested her attention; and in about three
weeks she committed herself upon the Sabbath and
its attendant truths. The next week she sent to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_099">[099]</span>
&ldquo;Advent Review&rdquo; the piece of poetry entitled &ldquo;Fear
not, Little Flock,&rdquo; which was her first contribution
to that paper. The &ldquo;Review&rdquo; was then published
in Saratoga, N. Y., and she was immediately requested
to take a position in that office. She replied
that she could not, on account of the trouble with
her eyes, but was told to come as she was, or to that
effect. Arriving there, the directions in James 5:14,
15, were followed, and her eyes were so far strengthened
in answer to prayer, that she was soon enabled
to engage without restraint in the work of the office.</p>
<p>With strong faith and fervent zeal, she entered
heartily into the work. She rejoiced in the new-found
truth. The whole current of her mind was
changed, and nobler aspirations took possession of
her heart. From a position of exaltation and honor
among men, she had now turned her eyes to an inheritance
incorruptible, undefiled, reserved in Heaven
for the followers of Christ, and to a place at last with
the redeemed before the throne. Her contributions
to the &ldquo;Review&rdquo; while it was published in Saratoga
and Rochester, N. Y., afterwards published in her
volume of poems, entitled, &ldquo;Home here, and Home
in Heaven,&rdquo; show the themes upon which her mind
delighted to dwell.</p>
<p>In November, 1852, as already stated, she was
called home by the sickness of her father, who died
the first of December following. In January, 1853,
before returning to N. Y., she was solicited, in connection
with her brother Uriah, to take charge of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Academy in Mont Vernon, N. H., with a salary for
the first year, of one thousand dollars, and a prospect
of increase as they should bring the school up to a
greater degree of prosperity. But she preferred to
labor in some capacity where her efforts would tend
more directly to spread a knowledge of the truth
among the people, and lead them to seek salvation
through Christ the Saviour of men. She therefore
declined the offer, preferring, without any pecuniary
consideration, to again connect herself with the
office.</p>
<p>Two years later, in November, 1854, she came home
to West Wilton, suffering under the first stages of
that disease which shortly brought her to the grave.
The following from a letter to a friend, written soon
after her death, sets forth the occasion of her last
sickness, and the circumstances attending the closing
hours of her life:</p>
<p class="bq">On account of sickness in the family where she
boarded, she assisted in the kitchen awhile, where was
a warm stove, and in consequence of a letter being
left, she hastened with it to the office unprepared for
a cold, wet morning. Had she returned immediately,
as she should have done, all might have been well.
But she stayed through the day, as her work was
there, and became very cold and chilly. That cold
undoubtedly seated itself immediately upon her lungs,
and threw her into night sweats and a hard cough,
which ended but with her life.</p>
<p class="bq">So rapid was the wasting process of her disease,
that within six weeks from the time she took the
cold, she rode up in the cars, on her way home, with
an intimate acquaintance of hers who did not know
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
her. He told me he thought of her, but thought it
could not be Annie, she was so altered in her looks,
being so poor and pale. Her brother Samuel said he
did not think he should have known her had he met
her unexpectedly, and said with a most dejected look,
&ldquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t think she will live.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="bq">She came home the 7th of November, kept about
and worked some till about the 1st of December, when
she had a very distressed day, and raised blood. Having
confidence in water treatment, she went where
she could receive such treatment, to see the effect it
would have, and to get information. She continued
this course till the following February. She felt better
while under the exhilarating effect of the water,
but became satisfied that she was no better.</p>
<p class="bq">The 14th of February, most providentially, Bro.
Joseph Bates called on us, and stopped till the 18th.
This was the occasion of a great blessing to her. At
the commencement of the Sabbath, the 16th, the
spirit and power of God descended upon her, and she
praised God with a loud voice. I felt at the same
time the sweet influence of Heaven, and the presence
of holy angels. I believed God was hearing prayer,
and granting his blessing, and joined them in praising
and giving glory to his name. Bro. B. then
said to Annie, &ldquo;You needed this blessing, and now if
the Lord sees that it is best for you to be laid away
in the grave, he will go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="bq">She appeared some stronger and better a few days
in the day time, but I could not see that she rested, or
was much different nights. Her cough remained obstinate,
and I do not think the disease was ever stayed.
She was greatly strengthened in a spiritual point of
view, and engaged more earnestly in exhorting people
to believe the Word, and be ready for the coming
of the Lord. She would feel impressed to go out and
talk with different individuals upon the truth, and
was strengthened and blessed in so doing. Victory
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
was generally gained, so that the truth was verified,
that whom the Lord makes free is free indeed. We
had from that time as long as she lived, some of the
most sweet, melting seasons of prayer that I ever enjoyed,
often accompanied with shouts of praise to the
Lord.</p>
<p class="bq">It was evident to all around that Annie was failing.
Her symptoms became alarming. The 20th of
March her brother Samuel was taken suddenly and
very sick with influenza and fever, three miles and
a half away at his boarding place, and unable to get
home. Annie said I must go and attend upon him,
even if she never saw me again.</p>
<p class="bq">The 30th she went to Mason Village to stay with
sister Gorham, while I was with her brother. While
there, word came that Annie was much worse. The
12th of April I went to Mason Village, and found
her very much worse than I expected. For twelve
days her death was almost hourly expected by those
around. She said to me, &ldquo;Mother, that poem I&rsquo;ve
been writing since January, 1855, [since published
under the title of &ldquo;Home Here and Home in Heaven,&rdquo;]
I suppose must all be lost. It is unconnected,
and nothing can be done with it to advantage, without
me.&rdquo; I went to Wilton and got the papers containing
what she had written, but she was not able to
do anything with them. She then prayed that she
might be enabled to finish the poem, and prepare the
book she had in contemplation; that if she did not
live, it might be that through it, she being dead would
yet speak, and that good might be done.</p>
<p class="bq">Sabbath April 21, the meeting was at sister Gorham&rsquo;s.
We did not hold it in her room on account
of her low state of health, but went in to close the
exercises, when to our surprise she commenced praying
with more than usual strength. The presence of
God was manifested, and his power rested down upon
her in a remarkable manner. She said she was
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
raised up to go home, and to do the will of the Lord.
She rested better that night than she had for a long
while. The next day she rode to Wilton, seven miles,
to the astonishment of all. Many from our village
had been to see her, and taken their leave, never expecting
to see her again; and when they saw the carriage
drive up, they came in to inquire when she
died. Great was their surprise to find her able to
walk about the room. She was again in her own
quiet home, and soon commenced on her work. She
was not able to write much herself, and I kept paper
and pencil to write what she dictated at her will.</p>
<p class="bq">The 28th of May she had arranged and composed
the last verse of her poem &ldquo;Home Here and Home in
Heaven.&rdquo; The 29th, her brother Uriah came home
just in time to write it off for the press, and to assist
her in arranging her other poetry for reprinting.
She, however, made some alterations, and some little
additions while he was copying it.</p>
<p class="bq">She dreamed in February that she was with a people,
seemingly spectators, and before her was the most
beautiful road, which glistened like gold. There was
a company arranged by the side, and some one came
to her with a peony, and said to her, &ldquo;You must go
over upon that road and hold up this peony.&rdquo; She
stood there dressed in white, holding up the peony,
when she awoke with the most pleasing impression,
that she had yet something more to do for the Lord.
She fully believed after she came from Mason,
that she should accomplish the work she had in view,
and that this was what was represented by her dream.
The peony was her favorite flower, and as soon as
they were in blossom, Uriah sketched and engraved
one for the book, as is seen on the title page.</p>
<p class="bq">She often said in view of her dream, that when the
book was done there would be a change in her. She
should either be raised up to live, or she should die.
Her prayer was answered. The book was all done
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
on her part, and as she had a desire to see the proof-sheet
of her poem, and heard that help was needed
at the office, she said to Uriah, &ldquo;I feel bad to have
you staying on my account, when it seems you might
be accomplishing more good.&rdquo; It was thought she
might live till frosty nights, if no longer. Under
these considerations, Uriah left for Rochester the 17th
of July. He had not been gone with the manuscript;
more than three hours, when she said, &ldquo;I am ready
now to die;&rdquo; and she did not live quite ten days after.</p>
<p class="bq">The 18th she wrote the piece &ldquo;Our Duty.&rdquo; The
19th, at 3 o&rsquo;clock, <span class="sc">P. M.</span>, she said, &ldquo;Mother, some
change has taken place. I don&rsquo;t think I shall live
through the day.&rdquo; I saw there was a change, and
stayed by her. Night drew on. No one happened
in. She said, &ldquo;It seems to me I could not breathe to
have many in the room.&rdquo; I told her I was not afraid
to be alone with her if she did die. She seemed gratified,
as she wanted everything as quiet as could be,
and she was not able to talk much with people if they
were in. Her brother John and myself stayed with her
during the night, when it seemed that any moment
might be her last. She delivered many messages
for different individuals, especially for her brother
Samuel, if she did not live to see him. She said,
&ldquo;My mind was never clearer; I could do a sum in
arithmetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="bq">About 2 o&rsquo;clock she looked very happy. I said to
John, &ldquo;Annie is being blessed.&rdquo; She soon exclaimed,
&ldquo;Glory to God,&rdquo; a number of times, louder than she
had spoken for a long while. She said, &ldquo;Heaven is
opened. I know Jesus is mine, and that he will save
me. I shall come forth at the first resurrection;&rdquo;
and exhorted us to prepare for the time of trouble,
and to be ready to meet her at that day, which she
said she did not think was far distant.</p>
<p class="bq">Friday morning, the 20th, I wanted to write to
Uriah, but she said &ldquo;It will make no difference, I think
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
I am dying; don&rsquo;t leave me, mother, while I live.&rdquo;
We sent for Samuel, and for sister Gorham. She remained
about the same. Those who came in thought
she must be just gone. They said it did not seem
like a sick and dying room, she appeared so happy.
She would look upon them and smile when she could
not speak. Sabbath, July 21, she seemed better.
Sunday, the 22d, more distressed, though she had
some pleasing, and I trust profitable intercourse with
her relatives and some of her particular friends.
Monday morning, more comfortable. Some of us entertained
hopes that she might, even then, revive and
live. Monday night her distress returned. She said,
&ldquo;I think I cannot live.&rdquo; Thursday morning, the 24th,
she composed her last two verses, &ldquo;Oh! shed not a tear
o&rsquo;er the spot where I sleep,&rdquo; &amp;c. In the afternoon
she had a conflict with the enemy, and seemed to lose
sight of Jesus. I told her it was no strange thing;
it was only a sign the Lord was near and would deliver.
She found it even so. Before night she was
enabled to triumph over all the powers of darkness,
and praised God aloud. She prayed for patience to
suffer all her Father&rsquo;s will, saying, &ldquo;I shall not suffer
any too much. I can bear anything while Jesus sustains
me;&rdquo; and many like expressions.</p>
<p class="bq">Tuesday night was a solemn and interesting night.
I stayed with her alone through the night. Neither
of us slept. She was very happy, and talked much
with me. She said in her former familiar way, &ldquo;My
mother, I&rsquo;ve been afraid I should wear you all out.
I&rsquo;ve called after you by night and by day.&rdquo; She felt
bad to have me kept up as I was on her account.
But she said, &ldquo;I am here now, your dying girl. I
think this is the last night, and you must be sure to
rest when I am gone. O, my blessed mother, I shall
bless you in Heaven for taking such care of me. No
sorrow or suffering there. We shall all be free there.
Yes, we shall all be free when we arrive at home, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
we shall live forever. Yes, and I can smile upon you
now through all my sufferings.&rdquo; It was her last
suffering night. Wednesday, the 25th, a death coldness
was upon her. In the afternoon she became
more free from pain and distress. While speaking in
the evening of taking care of her, she said, &ldquo;I shall
not want any one to sit up; you can lie on the lounge.&rdquo;
At 1 o&rsquo;clock I called Samuel. She talked with him,
called for what she wanted as usual, and told him he
might lie down. About three o&rsquo;clock she called him
to wet her head with water, and said she felt sleepy.
She was indeed going into her last sleep. Samuel
wet her head, and soon after spoke to me and said,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but Annie is dying.&rdquo; I spoke to her.
She took no notice, breathed a few times, and died
apparently as easy as any one going into a natural
sleep. Her sufferings were over. She was gone. It
was 4 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, July 26, 1855.</p>
<p class="bq">She gave many directions about her burial; wanted
as little parade as possible. We were expecting Bro.
and sister White. We had had a letter from Bro. H.
O. Nichols, saying they were expected there, and
would be likely to call on us about that time. Brn.
Bates, Burr and Nichols were written to, but circumstances
prevented any of them from attending her
funeral. Bro. Hastings and others spoke, prayed, and
sung, to the edification of all. The hymns selected
were, &ldquo;Unconscious now in peaceful sleep,&rdquo; and &ldquo;She
hath passed death&rsquo;s chilling billow.&rdquo; It has since
been said by the friends that they never attended a
more interesting funeral.</p>
<p class="bq">Annie looked very natural; more so than at any
time after she came home. It was remarked that a
holy sweetness seemed to rest upon her countenance,
while her remains were with us. Annie had many
favors shown her. For the interest and friendship
manifested, the friends have my sincere love and gratitude.
Though I ever thought much of them, they
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
seem doubly dear since her death, especially Bro. and
sister White, with whom she was so long connected.
Annie loved them, and manifested an interest for
them, and the work there till the last. Bro. White
made her the generous donation of seventy-five dollars
and other valuable presents, during her sickness.</p>
<p class="bq">It was a great satisfaction that I had Annie with
me, and that I was enabled to take care of her while
she lived. Her complaints required an uneven temperature
of the room, which was unfavorable for me.
I took one cold after another, and was very much
worn down at the time of her death. I took an additional
cold when she was buried, and have scarcely
been able to do anything since. I have thought sometimes,
that what I had the privilege of doing for Annie,
was worth my life, if it must go; and if it were
not that I was still needed as a mother, I would now
myself willingly lay off the burden of life&rsquo;s duties
and cares.</p>

<h2>POEMS, BY ANNIE R. SMITH.</h2>
<h3 id="c78">The Friends of my Youth: Where are They?</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh, where are they who once did tread</p>
<p class="t0">With me, in youth&rsquo;s sweet sunny morn,</p>
<p class="t0">The winding labyrinths that led</p>
<p class="t0">Where sweetest flowers the path adorn;</p>
<p class="t0">And gladsome birds send forth their lay,</p>
<p class="t0">And rivulets murmur on their way?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh, where are all the glad and gay,</p>
<p class="t0">That filled the brightly-lighted hall;</p>
<p class="t0">With loving hearts to music&rsquo;s lay,</p>
<p class="t0">Responded to the joyous call?</p>
<p class="t0">With blooming cheeks and beaming eye,</p>
<p class="t0">They dreamed of joy and heaved no sigh.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Some swept adown life&rsquo;s rolling tide,</p>
<p class="t0">By summer breezes borne along,</p>
<p class="t0">With prosperous gale they gently glide,</p>
<p class="t0">Like some sweet fairy boat of song;</p>
<p class="t0">And bask in pleasure&rsquo;s sunny fold,</p>
<p class="t0">And revel in their glittering gold.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And some are rudely borne along,</p>
<p class="t0">By dark misfortune&rsquo;s chilly blast;</p>
<p class="t0">The storm and tempest coming on,</p>
<p class="t0">The sky with clouds is overcast,</p>
<p class="t0">Till weary of their toil and care,</p>
<p class="t0">They sink in darkness and despair.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And some, whose sunny hopes have fled,</p>
<p class="t0">Like th&rsquo; withered and deserted flower,</p>
<p class="t0">On which no tenderness is shed,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">They sicken in a single hour;</p>
<p class="t0">And e&rsquo;en in youth and beauty&rsquo;s bloom,</p>
<p class="t0">Are ushered to the silent tomb.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And some in yonder graveyard sleep,</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath the ever verdant soil;</p>
<p class="t0">Where mortals ne&rsquo;er are known to weep:</p>
<p class="t0">They rest from all their pain and toil;</p>
<p class="t0">Away from care, from sin set free,</p>
<p class="t0">They peaceful rest, O God, in Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A few are left to struggle on,</p>
<p class="t0">Through dangers that beset life&rsquo;s way;</p>
<p class="t0">To mourn that all the loved are gone,</p>
<p class="t0">To weep and struggle, and to pray,</p>
<p class="t0">That all in Heaven at last may meet,</p>
<p class="t0">And joy each other there to greet.</p>

<p class="t">Some promise of the morn;</p>
<p class="t0">Some token from our absent Friend,</p>
<p class="t0">That soon our pilgrimage will end.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ay, soon the Lord will come!</p>
<p class="t">He will not suffer long</p>
<p class="t0">The triumph of our foes,</p>
<p class="t">The reign of sin and wrong.</p>
<p class="t0">With courage then still breast the storm,</p>
<p class="t0">For God has spoken and will perform.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yea, soon the Lord will come,</p>
<p class="t">And glad deliverance bring,</p>
<p class="t0">And crown with lasting joy</p>
<p class="t">All who have honored him.</p>
<p class="t0">When heaven and earth abashed shall flee</p>
<p class="t0">The glories of his majesty.</p>
